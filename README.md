The current repository is for a project named "Neuro-cognitive models of single-trial EEG measures describe latent effects of spatial attention during perceptual decision making" at the Shahid Beheshti University, by Amin Ghaderi-Kangavari, Jamal Amani Rad, Kourosh Parand, Michael D Nunez



## Description 
Current researchers separated visual encoding time (VEN) and motor execution time (MET) by N200 latencies which determine the onset of the evidence accumulation. Extraction of N200 latencies was based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to strengthen the single final waveform from whole electrodes. As a result, they found out spatial attention effect on face-care perceptual decision making.
